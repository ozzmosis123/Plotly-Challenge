# Plotly-Challenge

The Plotly library is used with Javascript to create a dashboard that filters test subjects that were tested for various microbial species that are found in the navel area. 

A JSON file containing all the data is read into the app.js while the HTML sends out to server.

Javascript is used to handle events that fetch new data to display on Plotly graphs each time a test test subject is selected.
